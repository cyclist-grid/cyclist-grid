# Raster

A simple Sass grid framework with an emphasis on [vertical rhythm](http://24ways.org/2006/compose-to-a-vertical-rhythm).

- **Automatic typographical hierarchy**: Now [traditional header font proportions](http://retinart.net/typography/typographicscale/) are set based on the body font size.
- **Traditional typographic grid**: The grid uses the leading vertically and the unit horizontally ([unit and leading](http://www.thinkingwithtype.com/contents/grid/)). Traditionally the unit is one em and the leading is greater than one em.
- **An HTML5 Canvas-based grid analysis system**
