# Raster

Raster is a simple typography and grid framework written in Sass.

## Features

* Starts by applying a CSS reset
* Replaces the default style of text tags (e.g., `P`, `H1`-`H6`, `Li`) with styles that follow traditional typography principles such as "typographical hierarchy" and "vertical rhythm".

## Usage

Raster requires Sass.

1. Import the `raster.scss` file from the `dist` folder into your own `scss` file. E.g., `@import "[path to raster]/dist/raster";`
2. Optionally, override the default `$font-size` and `$line-height` settings before the import line. For example:

		$font-size: 15px;
		$line-height: 20px;
		@import "[path to raster]/dist/raster";

Alternatively, a pre-compiled default CSS file is also included in the `dist` folder.

## Typography

### Typographic Hierarchy

[Traditional typography defines](http://markboulton.co.uk/journal/five-simple-steps-to-better-typography-part-4) the following font sizes:

* `6pt`: nonpareil
* `7pt`: minion
* `8pt`: brevier or small text
* `9pt`: bourgeois or galliard
* `10pt`: long primer or garamond
* `11pt`: small pica or philosophy
* `12pt`: pica
* `14pt`: english or augustin
* `18pt`: great primer
* `21pt`: double small pica or double pica
* `24pt`: double pica or two-line pica
* `36pt`: double great primer or 2-line great primer

Using those values as is in CSS is simple, but then only a few appropriate font sizes are available for body text (e.g., perhaps `10pt` to `18pt` or "long primer" to "great primer").

Raster's solution is to instead treat the traditional font sizes as *ratios* of these traditional sizes in order to define header sizes based on a body font size. Raster uses the `12pt` pica as to define the hierarchical font sizes as ratios as follows:

* "double great primer": 36 / 12
* "double pica": 24 / 12
* "double small pica": 21 / 12
* "great primer": 18 / 12
* "english": 14 / 12
* "pica": 12 / 12

It then maps these ratios to HTML header tags:

* `H1`: double great primer
* `H2`: double pica
* `H3`: double small pica
* `H4`: great primer
* `H5`: english
* `H6`: pica

Since the header sizes are defined as ratios to the body size, this means that any header will remain in proportion regardless of which body size is defined. The header font sizes are calculated as follows: `[body size] * [ratio]`. E.g., if the body font size is `15px`, then the `H1` header font size will be `15 * (36 / 12) = 45px`.

### Vertical Rhythm

A [vertical rhythm](http://24ways.org/2006/compose-to-a-vertical-rhythm) is making sure the spacing of elements consistently aligns to the baseline grid.

Raster aligns elements to the baseline grid using the following rules:

* All default margins and padding are set to zero by the CSS reset.
* The line height is used as the leading.
* All block level elements are given a bottom margin equal to the leading. (The exception to this is hierarchical sublists, which have a bottom margin of zero. I.e., a list within a list does not have a bottom margin)
* Headers are fitted to the closest matching line height that's a multiple of the leading. E.g., if the calculated header height is `21px` and the leading is `17px`, then the line height of the header will be `34px`. (This is in addition to having a bottom margin since headers are block level elements.)

## Implementation Notes

* Only pixels can be used to set the `$font-size` and `$line-height` variables. This is because that ratio of one to the other is used in various calculations, so it's necessary for their implementation to be simple and consistent.
